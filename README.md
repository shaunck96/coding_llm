# LLaMA-Titan: A State-of-the-Art Reasoning and Coding Language Model

This repository contains the implementation of **LLaMA-Titan**, a state-of-the-art language model that integrates the **Titan architecture** with the **LLaMA-2** foundation model. The model is designed for long-context reasoning and coding tasks, leveraging advanced memory mechanisms to handle complex dependencies effectively.

---

## Features

### 1. **LLaMA-2 Integration**
The model uses **LLaMA-2-7B**, a powerful transformer architecture, as the backbone. LLaMA-2 excels at natural language understanding and generation tasks, providing a strong foundation for further enhancement.

### 2. **Titan Memory Mechanism**
The Titan architecture incorporates **Neural Memory Modules**, enabling the model to:
- Dynamically update long-term memory using a "surprise-based" mechanism.
- Balance short-term attention with persistent memory, allowing for efficient long-context handling.
- Scale efficiently to handle large datasets and extended sequences.

### 3. **Diverse Dataset Support**
The code supports training on a wide range of code-related datasets, including:
- **CodeSearchNet**: Large-scale (comment, code) pairs across multiple languages.
- **The Stack**: A diverse collection of permissively licensed code.
- **CodeParrot APPS**: Coding problems and solutions for benchmarking.

### 4. **High Performance**
- **Gradient Accumulation**: Simulates larger batch sizes on memory-constrained GPUs.
- **Dynamic Scheduling**: Implements a linear learning rate scheduler with warmup for stable optimization.
- **Distributed Training**: Uses the `Accelerator` library to efficiently train across multiple GPUs.

### 5. **Experiment Tracking**
- Tracks hyperparameters, metrics, and loss values using **MLflow**.
- Saves checkpoints for reproducibility and later inference.

## Installation

To set up the environment, install the necessary dependencies:

```bash
pip install torch torchvision transformers datasets tokenizers accelerate deepspeed mlflow
```

---

## Usage

### 1. **Configuration**
Modify the `Config` class in the code to adjust the hyperparameters:

- `MODEL_NAME`: Pre-trained model to use (default: `meta-llama/Llama-2-7b-hf`).
- `MEMORY_SIZE`: Size of the neural memory module (default: `4096`).
- `BATCH_SIZE`: Number of samples per batch (default: `8`).
- `EPOCHS`: Number of training epochs (default: `5`).
- `DATASET_NAMES`: List of datasets for training.

### 2. **Model Architecture**
The `LlamaTitanModel` class integrates LLaMA-2 with Titan's memory modules:
- **NeuralMemory**: Updates memory based on input "surprise," combining new and old information dynamically.
- **Attention Mechanism**: Combines memory outputs with token embeddings for richer contextual understanding.
- **Classifier**: Final layer for task-specific outputs, e.g., binary classification for reasoning.

### 3. **Data Preprocessing**
The `load_and_preprocess_data` function:
- Loads datasets from Hugging Face.
- Tokenizes inputs using the `LlamaTokenizer` to ensure compatibility with LLaMA-2.
- Supports mixed datasets to provide diverse training samples.

### 4. **Training**
The `train_model` function:
- Uses the `Accelerator` library for efficient distributed training across multiple GPUs.
- Implements gradient accumulation to simulate large batch sizes.
- Logs metrics and parameters to MLflow during training.
- Saves checkpoints after training for later use.

---

## Workflow

1. **Load and Preprocess Data**:
   - Combines datasets like CodeSearchNet and The Stack.
   - Tokenizes inputs with truncation and padding.

2. **Initialize Model**:
   - Instantiates `LlamaTitanModel`, integrating LLaMA-2 with Titan memory.

3. **Train the Model**:
   - Optimizes weights using AdamW with weight decay.
   - Adjusts the learning rate dynamically with a scheduler.

4. **Log and Save**:
   - Tracks training metrics with MLflow.
   - Saves model checkpoints for reproducibility.

---

## Hyperparameter Tuning

To achieve the best performance:
- Increase `MEMORY_SIZE` and `MAX_LENGTH` for tasks requiring longer context handling.
- Adjust `LEARNING_RATE` and `BATCH_SIZE` based on available hardware.
- Use a mix of datasets to improve generalization across tasks.

---

## Example Output

### Training Logs (via MLflow)
```
Epoch 1/5, Loss: 2.1567
Epoch 2/5, Loss: 1.8234
Epoch 3/5, Loss: 1.5638
...
```

### Model Predictions (Reasoning Task)
**Input**: "Is the code snippet solving the Fibonacci problem?"
**Output**: "Yes"

---

## Extending the Code

### Add New Datasets
To add additional datasets:
1. Add the dataset name to `config.DATASET_NAMES`.
2. Ensure the dataset has a `text`, `context`, or `code` field for tokenization.

### Custom Tasks
Modify the `LlamaTitanModel` classifier for tasks like:
- Code summarization.
- Code completion.
- Question answering.

---

## Performance Optimization

### 1. GPU Utilization
Ensure that all available GPUs are utilized by initializing the `Accelerator` with `device_placement=True`.

### 2. Memory Management
- Reduce `BATCH_SIZE` or use gradient checkpointing for memory-constrained environments.
- Enable mixed precision training with `fp16` for faster computation.

### 3. Experiment Tracking
Use MLflow's UI to monitor metrics, analyze trends, and compare experiments.

## Limitations

1. **Hardware Requirements**: The model requires multiple high-memory GPUs (e.g., A100) for optimal performance.
2. **Long Training Times**: Large-scale training can take several hours to days depending on dataset size and model configuration.
